This is a website for a visualizer tool. First page is landing page that shows the product.

Second page is a data display table. This is just a proof of concept! The table will function 
differently and charts
will actually generate when you press visualize. These are just place holders.

*To add multiple values in row, use comma separated values!

The last page is a simple login page with email validation. Very simple page and will 
add to it in the future. It doesnt link or submit the
for just yet. For now it just checks if what was entered was an email 
using regex. Sends an alert box telling you to enter valid email
